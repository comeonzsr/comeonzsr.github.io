    <p>In response to the challenges in GIScience and national research agenda, the Center is positioned to lead and support campus-wide initiatives in two rapidly growing areas of excellence at UB: 
    <b>(1) Smart Health and (2) Environmental Informatics. </b>
    Both areas involve on-line social media, sensor systems, and cyber-computing. 
    The growth in these two areas can build on the existing GIScience infrastructure, critical mass of researchers and expertise, and the local GIS community, while resonating with goals stated in the Realizing UB2020 plan. </p>

         <h3>Smart Health</h3>
         <p>The use of online social media, real-time sensors, and cyber-computing to obtain and process health data is actively promoted by NIH to develop 'smart health' in order to address critical issues in health and health care.
          This national need is reflected in a series of recent CFAs issued by both NIH and NSF. UB is one of the few leading GIScience programs among US Universities that also has health-related schools. 
          This strength gives UB a strong competitive edge to secure external funding. 
          The Center will build synergies in the area of smart health and spatial epidemiology, and lead and supports the effort to pursue interdisciplinary health-related research and education grants.

     <div class="full-width"> 
         <h3>Environmental Informatics</h3>
         <p>There is a growing movement within hydrology, ecology, and other environmental research communities to rally around informatics as a core mandate, partly in response to requirements from funding agencies, notably NSF. 
         Central to environmental informatics is the use of (a) real-time sensors deployed in the environment/onboard satellite platforms to acquire information of high spatial, temporal, and thematic resolutions and
          (b) cyber-computing to process the massive volume of generated information. The two approaches offer novel ways to provide insights into environmental dynamics, 
          as societies increasingly rely on scientists to provide timely information on climate change and other concerns. 
          The Center is well positioned to lead and support the effort in the sensor system-based data analysis and modeling to address environmental issues. </p>

         NCGIA-Buffalo has been and will continue to organize a series of activities, including proposal development, funding opportunity seminars, speaker series, and conferences. 
         These activities will cultivate interests across the campus and leverage current research strengths to achieve the above goals.
